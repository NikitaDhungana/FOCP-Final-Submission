This document represents the final submission for the "Fundamentals of Computer Programming" module. The submission includes a repository organized into three separate folders: "Portfolio," "Project-chat," and "Project-f1," each containing different components of the work completed during the course.

The "Portfolio" folder compiles all the weekly assignments from the course. These tasks track my progress and development throughout the module, illustrating my growing understanding of programming concepts and the practical application of the skills learned.

The "Project-chat" folder contains an interactive system I developed to assist potential students through a chat interface. This system is designed to answer common questions, providing users with a simple and efficient way to obtain useful information.

The "Project-f1" folder features a program that processes timing data from a race system. This program analyzes the data and presents a detailed breakdown of the drivers’ performance, offering insights into their lap times and overall achievements.

Together, these folders reflect the complete scope of the work I’ve undertaken in the module, highlighting both the technical skills acquired and the practical application of programming techniques.
